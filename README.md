# Voice Gender Classification
This is a machine learning project that classifies human voice samples as **male** or **female** using extracted audio features.
The project includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Clustering using K-Means
- Classification using Random Forest
- A simple Streamlit web app for predictions

## üîç Features Used

The model uses various audio features like:
- Spectral centroid
- Bandwidth
- Pitch (mean, min, max)
- MFCCs (mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)
- Energy, contrast, flatness, skew, and more
